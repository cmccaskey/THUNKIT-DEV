## Description ###
![image goes here](IMAGES/32U2-DEV_1.png) <br />
The ATmega 32U2-Development is a microcontroller development board based around the Atmel ATmega32u2. The ATmega32u2 is a smaller version of the ATmega32u4 used on similar small form development boards. The ATmega32u2 is a great chip to use when a small, low cost, and powerful AVR MCU is needed. The ATmega32u2 comes from the factory with Atmel's DFU USB bootloader. Together the ATmega32u2-Development with avr-gcc and dfu-programmer makes for a great Open Source AVR development experience. C code is also simple to write for this MCU and together with LUFA (USB stack) the USB can be used to emulate numerous devices and interfaces. Note: the male headers do not come pre-soldered to the board.
